Predict the status of breast cancer using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset
Background information of the data and its source: http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one of the major causes of death among women worldwide. Every year approximately 124 out of 100,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and the estimation is that 23 out of the 124 women will die of this disease.

This dataset was created by Dr. William, Nick Street and Olvi in University of Wisconsin. The dataset contains 569 rows and 32 columns and it is widely used for this kind of application because it has a pretty large number of records and there are only a few missing values.
